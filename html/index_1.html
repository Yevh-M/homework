        <h1>Keep getting better</h1>
        <p>
            The <strong><i>main</i></strong> motivating factor that most influenced my final choices for changing the profession,
            joining the second higher education in KPI for direct software engineering and in this case,
            passing courses in PHP Academy, were the successes of my friends and acquaintances who were re-qualified
            from their non-technical professions for developers <u>(C#, Java, Web-design etc.)</u>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Repeatedly <strong><i>communicating </i></strong>with them was noticeable, how intensely they had to work on themselves
            and constantly become better. Their example has shown that it is never too late to change their
            directions and <u>priorities</u>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Looking <strong><i>at the great</i></strong> speed of progress that seems to move faster than geometric progression,
            I understand that sooner or later I have to go into communication with the technology at a lower level,
            why not do it <u>now</u>.
